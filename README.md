Data Structures And Algorithms

**Data Structures**: These are ways of organizing and storing data so that operations like insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal can be performed efficiently. Common examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and hash tables.

**Algorithms**: These are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. They include sorting (e.g., quicksort, mergesort), searching (e.g., binary search), and many others like graph traversal or dynamic programming techniques
